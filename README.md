## 🚀 Why This Repository Exists

AWS roles expect strong practical knowledge of:

- Architecting secure & scalable cloud environments  
- Using networking fundamentals (VPC, Subnets, NAT, Routing)  
- Implementing core AWS services (EC2, IAM, S3, RDS, Lambda, ECS, EKS)  
- Building CI/CD workflows  
- Monitoring, automation, and troubleshooting  

This repo helps demonstrate **hands-on skills**, not just theory—making it ideal for:

✔ Job interviews    
✔ Daily practice  
✔ Cloud engineering learning path  
✔ Real-world AWS scenarios
