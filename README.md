#  AWS Core Services Labs — Hands-On Real Time Scenerios

Welcome to **AWS Core Services Labs**, a complete hands-on, real-world lab scenerio based collection designed to demonstrate expertise in **AWS Cloud, DevOps, Infrastructure-as-Code, Security, Networking, Automation, and Monitoring**.

This repository contains **structured, production-oriented labs** covering the most important AWS services used in day-to-day cloud engineering roles.  
It showcases architecture skills, best practices, automation capabilities, and end-to-end implementation using AWS services.

## Why This Repository Exists?

AWS roles expect strong practical knowledge of:

- Architecting secure & scalable cloud environments  
- Using networking fundamentals (VPC, Subnets, NAT, Routing)  
- Implementing core AWS services (EC2, IAM, S3, RDS, Lambda, ECS, EKS)  
- Building CI/CD workflows  
- Monitoring, automation, and troubleshooting  

This repo helps demonstrate **hands-on skills**, not just theory—making it ideal for:

✔ Job interviews    
✔ Daily practice  
✔ Cloud engineering learning path  
✔ Real-world AWS scenarios
